            <p id="b">
                Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide
                the outcome. As one of the world powers
                battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
                military drive; but you can't do it alone.
                You have to form alliances and then betray your
                allies before they betray you!

                Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
                of the strike. Will it be a bombing
                raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion
                with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack,
                move into enemy territory with your forces and win
                the conflict.

                The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake.
                Buy armaments and develop secret
                weapons from your country's economic funds and
                natural reserves, but be sure to save
                something for the future. <br>

            <strong>Tedious and Confusing</strong> <br>
            --------------------- <br>
            The list of war simulation games is long. All of them
            share similar features including the
            formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated
            through random draws of a deck or the
            roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that
            is new or innovative in that regard.

            We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing.
            In fact, I dare say we spent more time
            reading and rereading the rule book than actually
            playing the game. If you want to read a
            book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu. <br>

            <strong>Decent Game but Many are Better</strong> <br>
            ------------------------------- <br>
            Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the
            game play to be robust and engaging. The
            rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with
            experience in this class of board games, there
            is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We
            think the battle simulation cards are some of
            the best we have encountered.

            All of that being said, the competition for this type
            of game is fierce. There are a lot of
            established titles with loyal clients. We're not
            exactly sure where Alliance fits in with
            that group. It's a good game, but not good enough
            to draw our attention away from games like
            Battle Tested and Global Conflict. <br>

            <strong>Fun and Challenging</strong> <br>

            ------------------ <br>
            Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to
            war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new
            ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the
            investment options give the game a "real world" feel.

            This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may
            be bored <br>
